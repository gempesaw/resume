My resume's source tex file(s) and associated generated pdf

I've always had trouble keeping track of the location of the most recent version of my resume. Sometimes I'll go a few months or a year without looking at the files and then I'm across multiple computers, different hard drives - sending different versions out to different people and companies also gets confusing. This should make things much easier :).
