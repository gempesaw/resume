Resume

[My resume][res], along with its source tex file(s) and associated
rendered files.

I've always had trouble keeping track of the location of the most
recent version of my resume. Sometimes I'll go a few months or a year
without looking at the files and then I'm across multiple computers,
different hard drives - sending different versions out to different
people and companies also gets confusing. This should make things much
easier :).
